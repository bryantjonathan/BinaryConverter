# Binary to Decimal Conversion

This repository contains a website that converts **binary numbers to decimal** using two methods: **Brute Force** and **Divide and Conquer**.

## Features

- **Divide and Conquer**: This method breaks the conversion process into smaller sub-problems, then combines the results to get the final solution. This method is more efficient in terms of computational time, especially for large-scale inputs.
- **Brute Force**: A traditional method that iteratively converts binary numbers into decimal through direct calculations.

## How to Use
